# 12-Weather-Project
Made this project with the help of Open Weather API , with the help of JavaScript using Express framework in Node.js

-> JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for building interactive and dynamic web pages. It is a scripting language that runs on the client-side (in the web browser) and, more recently, on the server-side (with the introduction of platforms like Node.js).

-> Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, enabling server-side scripting and building scalable network applications.

-> Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of features and utilities that simplify the process of building web applications and APIs. Express.js is known for its minimalist and unopinionated approach, allowing developers to have flexibility and freedom in structuring their applications.

-> What does localhost:3000 signify ??
1. "localhost:3000" is a common notation used to refer to a specific network address and port combination on a local machine. In the context of web development, it typically refers to the local development server running on your own computer.
2. "localhost": It is a hostname that refers to the current device or machine you are using. In simple terms, it points to your own computer or the loopback address (127.0.0.1) in IPv4 or (::1) in IPv6.
3. ":3000": It represents the port number on which the server is listening. Ports are used to distinguish different services or processes running on a single machine. Port 3000 is often used as the default port for web development servers, including those based on Node.js and Express.js.

-> What is NODEMON ??

The term "nodemon" refers to a widely used tool in the Node.js ecosystem called "nodemon" (short for Node Monitor). Nodemon is a command-line utility that helps in the development of Node.js applications by automatically restarting the application whenever changes are detected in the source code files. It is particularly useful during the development process as it saves developers from manually stopping and restarting the server every time they make changes to the code.

-> What is an API ??
1. API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. APIs define the methods and formats for requesting and exchanging data between systems, enabling seamless integration and interoperability.
2. In simpler terms, an API acts as an intermediary between different software applications, allowing them to access each other's functionalities and data. It provides a standardized way for developers to interact with a system or service, abstracting away the complexities of the underlying implementation.

-> What is Open weather API , that we used in our project ??
1. The OpenWeatherAPI is a service that provides weather data and related information for various locations worldwide. It allows developers to access current weather conditions, forecasts, historical data, and other weather-related information programmatically.
2. By integrating the OpenWeatherAPI into their applications or websites, developers can retrieve weather data for specific locations, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, precipitation, and more. The API supports various data formats, including JSON and XML, making it easy to consume and work with the weather data.
